Node.js QR code generator is a GitHub repository that contains the code for a web application that generates QR codes. The repository includes an HTML form that prompts the user to enter text or a URL, and then uses the qr-image module in Node.js to generate a QR code image that is displayed on the page.

The QR code generated can be downloaded as a PNG or SVG image file. The repository also includes a simple server-side script that listens for HTTP requests and generates QR codes on-the-fly.

This repository is useful for developers who want to learn how to generate QR codes using Node.js, or for those who want to quickly generate QR codes for their own projects or applications. The code is well-documented and easy to understand, making it a good starting point for those who are new to Node.js.
